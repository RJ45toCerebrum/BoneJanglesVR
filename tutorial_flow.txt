first time in the study session:

a) show UI of the PULL bone mechanic until they do it (UP on the right controller touch pad)
b) show the manipulation of bones with left controller (GRIP press controll)
c) selection of bones to see info (Down on the right controller touch pad)
d) UI sound to attract attention to the info board (Scalling / color / font the text is Crucially important)
e) After Bone selection, sub-mesh highlighting

thats about it!!
